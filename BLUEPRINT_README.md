### 🔧 Reference Configuration

**projects/justSteve/.worktrees/extract-packages/**
- `package.json` - Shows how domain projects depend on shared packages using `file://` protocol

## Quick Start Guide

### For Future Agents Working on New Projects

1. **Read the Blueprint**
   ```bash
   # Extract and read first
   tar -xzf enterprise-architecture-blueprint.tar.gz
   cat ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md
   ```

2. **Understand the Pattern**
   - Infrastructure tier: `/root/packages/`
   - Domain tier: `/root/projects/`
   - Domain projects use shared packages via `file://` protocol

3. **Bootstrap New Project**
   - Follow "Bootstrapping New Projects" section in blueprint
   - Reference the package source code as examples
   - Use Wayback Archive Toolkit structure as template

4. **Key Concepts**
   - Shared packages = unopinionated infrastructure
   - Domain projects = business logic organized by capability
   - Tests at all levels (package + domain)

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Creating a New Project
→ Read: ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md
→ Section: "Bootstrapping New Projects"
→ Copy shared packages to your `/root/packages/`
→ Follow the template

### Scenario 2: Migrating Existing Project
→ Read: ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md
→ Section: "5-Phase Migration Playbook"
→ Phase 1-5 with detailed steps
→ Reference Wayback Archive Toolkit as example

### Scenario 3: Understanding Architecture Decisions
→ Read: ARCHITECTURE.md
→ Read: "Decision Log" in ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md
→ See rationale for key choices

### Scenario 4: API Server Integration
→ Read: packages/api-server/README.md
→ Review: packages/api-server/src/server.ts
→ Follow usage examples

### Scenario 5: Dashboard UI Integration
→ Read: packages/dashboard-ui/README.md
→ Review: packages/dashboard-ui/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx
→ Follow usage examples

## Key Principles (Quick Reference)

1. **Infrastructure packages are unopinionated** - provide tools, not rules
2. **Domain code organized by capability** - not technical layers
3. **file:// protocol for development** - fast iteration
4. **Tests at all levels** - packages, domain, integration
5. **Documentation is mandatory** - every package has README

## Pattern Summary

```
Problem:
- Multiple projects need similar infrastructure
- Repeated boilerplate across projects
- Inconsistent patterns

Solution:
- Extract infrastructure → shared packages (@myorg/*)
- Keep domain logic → project-specific (organized by capability)
- Use file:// for development, versions for production

Result:
- Faster project setup
- Consistent patterns
- Less duplication
- Better maintainability
```
